### User Experience

#### 1. Initial Idea

- I decided to create a blog that would allow people to have a conversation about the latest news in the word of Anime and Manga. Since I'm a big fan of the art style.
- The inspiration came from the the classic blogs of the early 2000s, the difference was that I wanted to create a more user friendly and general experience.
- For that I would keep conversations in three basic categories Manga, Anime, Live Action. That way we can keep conversations about each medium in different spaces, and allow for a main post to have threads of comments like in a classic forum.

#### Color Scheme 

The colors selected will be between the range offer by the [materialize css/colors](https://materializecss.com/color.html)

1. Main Colors: Shades of grey will be use for all physical elements such as: Forms, Cards, and navigation bars.
2. Accents: Shades of amber will be use for different buttons, and interactive items from the dropdowns, some buttons.

#### Fonts

1. Roboto/Bold: was use due to the humanistic and readable characteristics of the font. The font is simple, clear, and easy to read. Additionally, the roundest of the font make it somehow approachable or friendly. This should create a welcoming/inviting experience.
2. DM Sans/Regular: Is use in combination with Roboto to create a good contrast. DM Sans is also a highly readable font, but the difference in weight should provide a good contrast to ensure a proper visual hierarchy. 

**Sizes**

To ensure font-readability and compliance with best practices, we ensure our minimal font size don't come under the recommended 16px. Additionally, by using the [flow-text](https://materializecss.com/typography.html) attribute from the Materialize CSS framework. I can make sure the framework calculate the minimal font size to stay consistent even in the smallest sizes
