### User Experience

#### 1. Project Goals
My first goal is to use my Fullstack skills to implement a forum with full CRUD capabilities where users can create post, delete them, and change them if needed. 

The forum should allow for users to like each other's post, create categories, and view all post per category. 

### 2. Epics and User Stories 

Find all Epics and User stories in the following [project board](https://github.com/users/jhoanTrujillo/projects/2)

### Design

#### Wireframe

- Mobile Wireframe link : [here](https://github.com/jhoanTrujillo/MangaTalk/blob/main/media/readme/Mobile_wireframe.pdf)
- Desktop Wireframe Link : Will add later, once mobile first approach is taken 

#### Color Scheme 

The colors selected will be between the range offer by the [materialize css/colors](https://materializecss.com/color.html)

1. Main Colors: Shades of grey will be use for all physical elements such as: Forms, Cards, and navigation bars.
2. Accents: Shades of amber will be use for different buttons, and interactive items from the dropdowns, some buttons.

#### Fonts

1. Roboto/Bold: was use due to the humanistic and readable characteristics of the font. The font is simple, clear, and easy to read. Additionally, the roundest of the font make it somehow approachable or friendly. This should create a welcoming/inviting experience.
2. DM Sans/Regular: Is use in combination with Roboto to create a good contrast. DM Sans is also a highly readable font, but the difference in weight should provide a good contrast to ensure a proper visual hierarchy. 

**Sizes**

To ensure font-readability and compliance with best practices, we ensure our minimal font size don't come under the recommended 16px. Additionally, by using the [flow-text](https://materializecss.com/typography.html) attribute from the Materialize CSS framework. I can make sure the framework calculate the minimal font size to stay consistent even in the smallest sizes
